Build:

This code requires Java 6.  If you are on Mac OS X, you'll need to install it
from http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/javaformacosx105update1.html - 
OS X ships with Java 5 by default.

Wave Protocol uses Ant to build. To run the tests, run:

<code>
  ant test
</code>

To build the server, run just 
<code>
  ant
</code>

It will be left in dist/fedone-X.Y.jar

Wave Protocol communicates using Protocol Buffers 
<http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/>
Because of the difficulty of distributing binaries, we do not include the 
protocol compiler in this distribution. Therefore, to rebuild updated 
protocol buffer files, you will need to install the binary protoc 
in your environment by fetching the protobuf code from the website 
above.

Additionally, you will have to update the build-proto.properties file to
point to the unpacked source distribution of the protocol buffers release.

Then, after updating a proto file, run

<code>
  ant -f build-proto.xml compile compile_json
</code>

Note: this generates files into proto_src. If files here exist without 
write permission, you will get permission denied errors from this step.

Note also that you don't need protoc unless you want to change the proto
files.
